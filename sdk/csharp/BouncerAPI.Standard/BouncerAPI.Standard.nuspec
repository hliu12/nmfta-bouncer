The API for the bouncer firewall appliance, automating blacklisting via `ufw`. See https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-bouncer for the server code.

The version documented here is API version `1.1`. All endpoints below have a `/v1.1/` leading path element.

## Authentication

This API uses Custom HTTP Header Bearer-token authentication. The following headers are required to be sent with each request

```http
Authorization: Bearer {access token from /login}
```

## Working with Date and Time

Dates and times in the API are treated as opaque data types at present. Any date-time format can be used as long as the code consuming it is consistent with the code populating it.

We recommend all times in UTC, formatted using ISO 8601 string (format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ`).

## Error Codes

Errors in this API are returned in JSON objects with error code references in an `Error` field. If an endpoint returns a status code other than `200` then it will return a JSON error object indicating the error in `Error` field. No descriptions of the error will be provided, client code or developers need to consult the table here to understand the value in the `Error` field.
